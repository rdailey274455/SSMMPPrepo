LAUNCH
> (After getting in but before launch) Two little axes with timing-based targeting (Kirby's Dream Course)
> Target based on mission route
> Farther away from target means longer trip (total distance) and/or more/harder obstacles or may make launch fail immediately or early

MISSION END
> Mission over: funny cutscenes
> Mission successful: parachute out, big explosion in background

CONTROLS
> Aim with mouse
> Thrust with left click
> Shield with right click

GAMEPLAY
> Starts in air after launch animation
> Rocket is initially at an upward angle, curves down to a downward angle by end of trip
> Constantly gravitating towards left side of screen, thrusting needed to stay in the game
> With warning prior, going off screen will result in a mission over

GAMEPLAY (HUD)
> HP, obstacles will lower this, mission over when depleted
> Score, distance elapsed and dodged obstacles will increase this (nearer dodge = bigger bonus?)
> Distance elapsed and total distance

UPGRADABLE THINGS (too many?)
> Aim agility
> Thrust amount, power, discharge rates, and recharge rates
> Shield amount, stability (how hard will obsticles damage it), discharge rates, and recharge rates
> Launch target timing slower, greater margin for error
> Area on map covered by successful mission
> Allowed distance from base for mission destination
> More bases
